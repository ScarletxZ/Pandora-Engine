# How to use Pandora Engine
To use Pandora Engine, you must know this things :

* `AI.js` and `syntaxError.js` was optional, but you miss the extra plugins if you do so. But with not inserting the AI and 
syntax error file in your directory will increase your speed. It is recommended to compile all of the files first in one file 
(PandoraEngine) and insert the compiled version there.
* For the usage in Forumotion, and another forum services, I doubt it. Scarlet and I would make it compactible for forum services.
